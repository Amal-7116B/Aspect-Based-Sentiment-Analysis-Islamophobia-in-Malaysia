# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis of Islamophobia in Malaysia

This is my Final Year Project analyzing Islamophobia on social media using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The project applies **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** with transformer models (DeBERTa, BERTweet) to detect sentiment towards different aspects of Islamophobia, such as religion, politics, race, and social issues.
